This repository serves as a valuable resource for individuals interested in understanding statistical models through practical implementations using Python and R. The main focus of this repository is to provide educational content through illustrative plots and code examples. This is an on-going project, so more scripts will be added over time. 

# In this repository, you'll find:

1. Jupyter Notebooks and Python scripts: Interactive notebooks featuring Python implementations of statistical models alongside detailed explanations.

2. R Scripts: Script files containing R code that showcases the implementation of statistical concepts in R programming language.
